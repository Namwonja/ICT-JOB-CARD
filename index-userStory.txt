As a new user, I landed on the home page of the ICT Job Card website. I then
had the option of logging in or registering as there were two buttons, the
Register and Login buttons.
Clicking on the Register button took me to a different page where I had to 
enter various details of myself.
Clicking on the Login button also redirected me to a different page where I had to 
log into the site using the details I provided in the register page.
